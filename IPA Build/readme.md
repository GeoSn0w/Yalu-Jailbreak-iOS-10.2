This is the IPA of my Yalu Jailbreak Fork (Yalu Dark).

* <b>Beta 13</b>
* Fixed some interface bugs in landscape mode.
* Added "Jailbreaking..." while the process takes place.
* Added a toggle to disable or enable Mobile Substrate
* Improved stability of the GUI (User interface), not of the Jailbreak itself!
* IPA can be installed with Cydia Impactor (Windows, OS X, Linux): http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/
* Beta 12 is not mirroring an update from Luca Todesco.
* IPA's HASH: 25795d435e023a9ab6da05ddc5067fccf86e95ec

Not required to check the SHA-1 hash, but highly recommended to prevent downloading corrupted, tampered files. ONLY download my Yalu Dark IPAs from THIS Git! I never host them anywhere else.

Key things to keep in mind:

* iPAs are precompiled from the same source-code available on my Git
* I only host Yalu DARK on this GitHub, any other links are most likely malware.
* You should be cautious from where you get IPAs especially if the source code is not provided, Yalu is not a toy, a malicious person can easily compile a malware IPA that uses Yalu's exploits, so always check the hashes, check the sources and AVOID SIGNED IPA STORES AT ALL COSTS!
* This is not the official version of yalu102 by @qwertyoruiopz, it is a fork by @fce365
