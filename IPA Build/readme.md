This is the IPA of my Yalu Jailbreak Fork (Yalu Dark).

* Beta 9
* SSH Connection via USB now Fixed
* IPA can be installed with Cydia Impactor (Windows, OS X, Linux): http://www.cydiaimpactor.com/
* Beta 9 is not mirroring an update from Luca Todesco.
* IPA's HASH: 853479685325c27daa5d44e2a27802bc5ec37572

Not required to check the SHA-1 hash, but highly recommended to prevent downloading corrupted, tampered files. ONLY download my Yalu Dark IPAs from THIS Git! I never host them anywhere else.

Key things to keep in mind:

* iPAs are precompiled from the same source-code available on my Git
* I only host Yalu DARK on this GitHub, any other links are most likely malware.
* Hotlinking is NOT allowed
* You should be cautious from where you get IPAs especially if the source code is not provided, Yalu is not a toy, a malicious person can easily compile a malware IPA that uses Yalu's exploits, so always check the hashes, check the sources and AVOID SIGNED IPA STORES AT ALL COSTS!
