# Yalu-Jailbreak-iOS-10.2
This is GeoSn0w (@fce365)'s Yalu Jailbreak fork for iOS 10.0 to 10.2 by qwertyoruiopz with reinvented UI, certification status, and Mobile Substrate Disable / Enable toggle. This complies with the fixes pushed for HDMI Adapter on the GitHub code that are not available in yalu102 official IPA.

Changes in Beta 13:
<B>Beta 13 comes as an improvement for Beta 12's interface so it shares the same features... only less interface bugs.</B>
* Shows "Jailbreaking..." while the process goes. Minor improvement, but neat.
* Now you can choose to Enable / Disable Mobile Substrate prior to the Jailbreak
* Improved Stability of the interface <b>(OF THE GUI NOT THE JAILBREAK ITSELF!)</b>
* New Settings section 
* Fixed landscape orientation issues.
* SHA SUM of this IPA: <b>25795d435e023a9ab6da05ddc5067fccf86e95ec</b>
* Beta 13 doesn't reflect new changes in yalu102 original project.
* This is a Beta Jailbreak, use at your own risk!
