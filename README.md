# Yalu-Jailbreak-iOS-10.2
This is GeoSn0w (F.C.E. 365 TV - iDevice Central)'s Yalu Jailbreak fork for iOS 10.0 to 10.2 by qwertyoruiopz with reinvented UI, certification status, and Mobile Substrate Disable / Enable toggle. This complies with the fixes pushed for HDMI Adapter on the GitHub code that are not available in yalu102 official IPA.
