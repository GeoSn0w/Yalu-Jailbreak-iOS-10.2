# Yalu-Jailbreak-iOS-10.2
This is GeoSn0w (F.C.E. 365 TV - iDevice Central)'s Yalu Jailbreak fork.
My own fork of Yalu Jailbreak for iOS 10.0 to 10.2 by qwertyoruiopz with support for iPhone 6/ 5S and iPod Touch 6, Dark UI and certification status.
I've decided to make this as Luca added support for iPhone 6 (7,2) on the project, but not on the compiled IPA, so while I was at it, I also decided to play a bit with the project and I added some extra features.
